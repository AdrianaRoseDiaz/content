#### Integrations
##### CrowdStrike Falcon X
- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/python3:3.10.1.26972*.
- Added indicators as command outputs to *cs-fx-get-full-report*, *cs-fx-get-report-summary*, *cs-fx-upload-file* (when `submit_file` and `polling` are both set to `true`) and *cs-fx-submit-uploaded-file* (when `polling` is set to `true`).
- Added the *source reliability* parameter for indicators.
- Added relationships between indicators to `dns_requests.address`, `dns_requests.domain` and `contacted_hosts.address` (when applicable).
- Added the option to run *cs-fx-find-reports* with the *hash* argument, to fetch data by a sha256 hash.
- Added the *!file* reputation command. It is equivalent to the existing *cs-fx-get-full-report*.
